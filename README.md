- Experiment with different CSS Text properies [MDN Text Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals)
- Also add somes styles using pseudo classes [MDN Pseudo Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes)
- Create some links to internal pages/sections of pages
- Include some images.  
- Add a radial gradiant as a background somewhere - [MDN Radial Gradiant](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/radial-gradient()) 
  - [Radial Gradiant Generator](https://cssgradient.io/)
